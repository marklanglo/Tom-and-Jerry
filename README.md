# Tom-and-Jerry
This is a graphical program where one dot(Tom) pathfinds to the bouncing ball(Jerry) until Jerry is caught.
It uses panels and a frame to create a window, the window is divided into 3 panels.  One panel makes up the
titlecard, one is for the buttons and fields, and the last one in the center is used for graphics

Here imaged is the button cluster which has the buttons 'Clear', 'Start', and 'Quit'.  'Start' will toggle to
'Pause' once it is clicked and back again if clicked once more.  The clear button will reset the fields to blank.

need to know before starting the program.
